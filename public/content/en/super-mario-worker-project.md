Super Mario Worker Project (SMWP) is an unofficial Mario level editor based on Softendo's Mario Worker 1.1 (aka Game Maker ver.).  
It enhances and expands upon MW 1.1 by introducing new elements and fixing various bugs, while preserving its original physics behavior and level format structure.

Mario and all relatives belong to Nintendo. Mario Worker, Super Mario Worker Project and INNOVATION LEAP are not affiliated with Nintendo in any way. Super Mario Worker Project is a non-profit game made by the fans, so no financial gain is made from the project.

SMWP is freeware and is completely free of charge. If you paid for this game, you were ripped off!

**Latest stable version:** v1.7.11
**Latest pre-release version:** v1.7.12-beta4

### Notice

**--Before running the program--**

1. Make sure .NET Framework 4.0 or newer is installed on your system. If you're using Windows 7/XP, you will need to manually download and install it. Windows 8 and newer already include newer versions of .NET Framework by default, so no additional action is required.
2. Download [Data.7z](https://file.marioforever.net/smwp/Data.7z), extract it, and place the Data folder into the same directory as the SMWP executable (for example, SuperMarioWorkerProject_v1.x.x.exe). If you already have the Data folder, please ensure it is located in the same directory as the SMWP executable.

**--Additional Notes--**

1. All current updates of Super Mario Worker Project v1.x are based on Mario Worker 1.1 (Game Maker ver.).
2. SMWP saves levels in the .smwl format by default. This format is not compatible with Mario Worker 1.1 or SMWP v0.x.  
Levels saved in this format can be loaded by the current or any newer version of SMWP v1.x. However, if you try to load them with an older version of SMWP v1.x, a warning will appear, and some level elements may be lost.  
You can also open .mfl levels created in Mario Worker 1.1, but SMWP cannot save levels in the .mfl format.
3. SMWP is still under active development. If you encounter any issues, please contact INNOVATION LEAP.

### FAQ

**Q: What is Super Mario Worker Project? Is this developed by Softendo?**  
**A:** We once hoped that Softendo would release a new version of Mario Worker 1.1, but those hopes never came true.  
Throughout MW's history, there have been several titles such as Mario Worker 1.0, Mario Worker 2, and Mario Worker Remake, which were either level editors from Mario Forever or fan-made remakes. However, none of them could replace Mario Worker 1.1 within the Chinese Mario Worker community.  
Therefore, in July 2015, a small development group from this community began working on a new editor based on Mario Worker 1.1, naming the project Super Mario Worker Project (SMWP). The team was later officially established as INNOVATION LEAP (INL) in June 2016 to continue the development.  
Its goal is to deliver a refined and expanded Mario Worker 1.1, fixing bugs and adding new features to meet players' expectations.

**Q: Is SMWP developed from scratch?**  
**A:** No. We obtained the source code of Mario Worker (GM ver.), the version bundled with Mario Forever 4.1 (which is basically the same as 4.4), and we have been improving it by fixing bugs and adding new features.

**Q: I encountered a grey screen when opening a level.**  
**A:** Make sure .NET Framework 4.0 or newer is installed on your system.

**Q: Why don't you add the features that Mario Forever fangames have?**  
**A:** Super Mario Worker Project is fundamentally different from the Mario Forever fangames. Our current version is still based on the original Mario Worker 1.1 code by Softendo, which was never well-structured or bug-free. Hastily modifying its internal systems, such as physics or object parameters, would easily break compatibility with existing levels.  
We plan to rebuild the editor from the ground up in the next major version (v2.0), completely independent from the original code. Once that happens, adding more advanced features from Mario Forever fangames will become possible.
