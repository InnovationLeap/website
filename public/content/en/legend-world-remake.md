title: Legend World Remake v2.0
---

**Legend World Remake (LWR, LGR)** is a fan game created by **INNOVATION LEAP**, based on *Mario Forever* (Rainbow Engine) and the [original *Legend World* on Mario Worker 1.1](/en/legend-world-remake/legend-world-on-mario-worker) by Nmnmoooh.

### Overview
Legend World Remake v2.0 features three layers of content:

#### Main Worlds
The game contains 8 main worlds around 100 levels, including:  
- Numbered stages (7–8 per world)  
- Lettered stages (2–3 per world)  
- Mini games (1–2 per world)  
- Boss battles

#### The Purple Coin System
A total of 120 optional challenges are added to the stages, covering objectives such as collection, restrictions, and exploration.  
Each completed challenge awards a Purple Coin, which can unlock additional content.  
Difficulty ranges from easy to extremely hard, often exceeding the challenge of the original stages.  
The Purple Coin system is intended to provide meaningful side objectives rather than artificial padding. Each challenge is designed to suit its stage, aiming for variety and depth instead of repetition.

#### Extra Levels
By collecting Purple Coins, players can unlock a set of additional levels.  
These include both reimagined stages from other Mario Worker 1.1 episodes and entirely original designs.

---

Achieving 100% completion requires finishing all three layers of content.

#### Redesigned World Maps
All world maps have been completely rebuilt. Levels can now be freely chosen and replayed.  
The game also supports auto-saving whenever the player returns to the map after completing a level.

#### The Final Chapter: World 8
World 8 is more than a continuation: it is the conclusion of the entire remake.  
Through both reinterpretation and original design, it delivers the definitive "final world, final level, and final boss" experience.
